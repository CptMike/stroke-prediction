# 🧠 Stroke Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project builds a predictive model to determine the likelihood of a stroke based on health and demographic information.

## 📚 Project Description

- Trained and evaluated models including Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
- Used SMOTE to handle class imbalance between stroke and non-stroke cases.
- Evaluated using precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.

## 📁 Files

- `Stroke.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook with preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python packages used.
